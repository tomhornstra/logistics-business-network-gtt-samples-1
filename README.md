## Description
You can find the template code for [SAP Logistics Business Network, global track and trace option]( https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_LBN_GTT_OPTION/LBN/en-US?task=discover_task) in this project. The project aims to provide examples to build your own tracking application based on the option. You can either implement the sample code or customize it to fit your needs. For each tracking scenario, the template code includes: 
* ERP extractors to send out the tracked processes and events to global track and trace option (ABAP) 
* Tracked process model that needs to be imported into global track and trace option (model file) 
* Backend and frontend codes to build Fiori application on global track and trace option (Java and JavaScript)
 
## Requirements
* An SAP Business Technology Platform global account with entitlement to the global track and trace option for SAP Logistics Business Network, 1 portal service quota and 2 GB Application Runtime quota.
* To integrate the global track and trace option with ERP, your SAP ERP system should be running on Netweaver 7.31 or higher with SAP Notes 2370356, 2937175, and 2974952 being implemented. Besides, to implement the template apps' extractor codes, your SAP ERP system version should be S4 1909 SP03 on premise or higher.
* The node “Interface to Global Track and Trace” in the IMG and the related GTT-specific versions of the IMG activities are available in the software component version SAP_BW 750 from SP 12 on. They cannot be downloaded as a correction via note assistant. We recommend upgrading to the service package level accordingly.
* To integrate with visibility provider, log your incidents in SAP BCP system with component “SBN-LBN-GTT-APP”.
