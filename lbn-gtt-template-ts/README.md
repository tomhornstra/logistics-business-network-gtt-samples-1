## Requirements
* An SAP Business Technology Platform global account with entitlement to the global track and trace option for SAP Logistics Business Network, 1 portal service quota and 2 GB Application Runtime quota.
* To integrate the global track and trace option with ERP, your SAP ERP system should be running on Netweaver 7.31 or higher with SAP Notes 2370356, 2937175, and 2974952 being implemented. Besides, to implement the template apps' extractor codes, your SAP ERP system version should be S4 1909 SP03 on premise or higher.
* The node “Interface to Global Track and Trace” in the IMG and the related GTT-specific versions of the IMG activities are available in the software component version SAP_BW 750 from SP 12 on. They cannot be downloaded as a correction via note assistant. We recommend upgrading to the service package level accordingly.
* To integrate with visibility provider, log your incident in SAP BCP system with component “SBN-LBN-GTT-APP”.

## Limitations
1.	To integrate with visibility provider, the following code list sent out from ERP system should be consistent with the code list in Track SO Fulfillment template model: </br>
transportation mode code, shipping type code, tracked process type code, carrier reference document type code</br>  
2.	To integrate with shipment and freight order/freight booking at the same time, please implement the Track Shipment Extractor and Track SO Fulfillment Extractor in different ERP system. This is because Track Shipment Extractor and Track SO Fulfillment Extractor share the same AOT Type name. </br>

## FAQs
* Why are some stops missing in the map? </br>
Check if you have updated the right geocoordinates for those locations in the Manage Locations app. </br>

* Why are some actual events missing in the map? </br>
Only events with valid geocoordinates are shown in the map. </br>

* How is the shipment’s execution status changed? </br>
By default, the shipment’s execution status is “Not Started”. </br>
If the shipment’s planned event is reported, the execution status will be changed to “In Transit”. </br>
If the shipment’s all planned PODs are reported, the execution status will be changed to “Completed”. </br>
Once the execution status is set as “Completed”, it cannot be changed any more. </br>
You can set your own execution status logic in Event-to-Action. </br>

## How to Obtain Support
The project is provided "as-is", with no expected support. </br>
If your issue is concerned with global track and trace option, log your incident in SAP BCP system with component “SBN-LBN-GTT-APP”.
