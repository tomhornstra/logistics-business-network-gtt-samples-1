* What is the ETA of my sales orders?
* …… </br>

## Requirements
* An SAP Business Technology Platform global account with entitlement to the global track and trace option for SAP Logistics Business Network, 1 portal service quota and 2 GB Application Runtime quota.
* To integrate the global track and trace option with ERP, your SAP ERP system should be running on Netweaver 7.31 or higher with SAP Notes 2370356, 2937175, and 2974952 being implemented. Besides, to implement the template apps' extractor codes, your SAP ERP system version should be S4 1909 SP03 on premise or higher.
* The node “Interface to Global Track and Trace” in the IMG and the related GTT-specific versions of the IMG activities are available in the software component version SAP_BW 750 from SP 12 on. They cannot be downloaded as a correction via note assistant. We recommend upgrading to the service package level accordingly.
* To integrate with visibility provider, log your incident in SAP BCP system with component “SBN-LBN-GTT-APP”.

## Download and Installation
* [02_Implementation_Guide-TSOF.pdf](https://github.com/SAP-samples/logistics-business-network-gtt-samples/blob/master/lbn-gtt-template-tso/Documents/02_Implementation_Guide-TSOF.pdf) 
* [03_Extractor_Creation_Guide-TSOF.pdf](https://github.com/SAP-samples/logistics-business-network-gtt-samples/blob/master/lbn-gtt-template-tso/Documents/03_Extractor_Creation_Guide-TSOF.pdf) 

## Limitations
* Limitations for Document Flow Implementation: </br>
Recommended number of layers in document flow: ≤6; </br>
For number of layers > 6, please use table view or extend the document flow by click. </br>
Recommended number of nodes in document flow: ≤500; </br>
For number of nodes > 500, please use table view. </br>

* Notes for ERP Extractor Implementation: </br>
The eventMatchKey of the shipment’s planned event = shipmentNo + stopId. "stopId" is set by the stage’s sequence. </br>
The eventMatchKey of the delivery's and delivery item's planned event is null. </br>
To integrate with visibility provider, the following code list sent out from ERP system should be consistent with the code list in Track SO Fulfillment template model: </br>
transportation mode code, shipping type code, tracked process type code, carrier refrence document type code  

## Known Issue
* If multiple IDOC payloads are generated at the same time or in a very short time in ERP, these payloads will enter the global track and trace system in disorder. This will cause update error in some situations. It is a known issue and is expected to be fixed in the next release.

## FAQs
* Why couldn’t my shipment events be correlated with the delivery and then with the delivery item? </br>
The correlation starts 90 minutes before the planned departure time of the shipment’s first stop and ends when the shipment’s last stop’s POD is reported. </br>
Only during the correlation period can the shipment events be correlated with the delivery and then with the delivery item. </br>
You can set your own correlation period in Event-to-Action by updating “validFrom” and “validTo” logic. </br>

* Why can’t I find any stops and any planned routes in the map? </br>
Check if you have assigned the delivery to any shipments. Or the shipments do not have any stages. </br>
 
* Why are some stops missing in the map? </br>
Check if you have updated the right geocoordinates for those locations in the Manage Locations app. </br>

* Why are some actual events missing in the map? </br>
Only events with valid geocoordinates are shown in the map. </br>

* How is the shipment’s execution status changed? </br>
By default, the shipment’s execution status is “Not Started”. </br>
If the shipment’s planned event is reported, the execution status will be changed to “In Transit”. </br>
If the shipment’s all planned PODs are reported, the execution status will be changed to “Completed”. </br>
Once the execution status is set as “Completed”, it cannot be changed any more. </br>
You can set your own execution status logic in Event-to-Action. </br>

* How is the delivery’s execution status changed? </br>
By default, the delivery item’ execution status is “Not Started”. </br>
If the delivery item’s planned event is reported, the execution status will be changed to “In Transit”. </br>
If the delivery item’s all planned PODs from shipment are reported or the delivery item’s own planned POD is reported, the execution status will be changed to “Completed”. </br>
Once the execution status is set as “Completed”, it cannot be changed any more. </br>
You can set your own execution status logic in Event-to-Action. </br>

## How to Obtain Support
The project is provided "as-is", with no expected support. </br>
If your issue is concerned with global track and trace option, log your incident in SAP BCP system with component “SBN-LBN-GTT-APP”.
